# PensionBuddy — Fix Status

Tracks every code in `docs/ISSUES.md`. Verified with `python3 tools/verify.py`
(headless Chrome audit at 375 / 1360 / 1440px + full-page screenshots in
`verify-out/shots/`). Baseline before any fix: **26 FAIL** across 12 pages.

## NEEDS DAMIAN INPUT

| Code | Where | What is needed |
|---|---|---|
| **A1** | `terms.html` §5 Limitation of liability | The liability cap figure. Currently renders as a marked placeholder "€[amount to be confirmed]". Search for `data-issue="A1"`. |
| **A4** | `terms.html` and `complaints.html` Contact sections | (1) A phone number — currently a marked placeholder "[phone number to be confirmed]", search for `data-issue="A4"`. (2) Confirmation that `hello@pensionbuddy.ie` is a real, monitored mailbox — it is used on terms, complaints and privacy. |
| **F1a** | every page, `ANALYTICS_SRC` | Which analytics provider (Plausible / GA4 / none). The guard self-disables until set; nothing loads. |
| **F1b** | both calculators, starter, tracker, director — `LEAD_ENDPOINT` | A form endpoint (Formspree, Netlify Forms, CRM webhook). Until set, capture points open a pre-filled email and show an honest on-screen fallback. |

## Category A — legal / content blockers · commit `7b8799b`

| Code | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | **Needs-Damian-Input** | `€[LIABILITY_CAP_EUR]` token replaced with a marked placeholder; sentence reads correctly; figure pending. |
| A2 | Fixed | All four "Template document / notice / process" and "Draft for legal review" boxes removed from terms, privacy, complaints. |
| A3 | Fixed | Single "Last updated: 9 July 2026" on terms and privacy. |
| A4 | **Needs-Damian-Input** | Developer comment removed; fake "Phone: book a call" replaced with a marked placeholder; email retained pending confirmation. |
| A5 | Fixed | 404 footer now carries the site-wide disclosure, not the complaints text. |
| A6 | Fixed | Privacy Notice publishes the data controller's email and postal address; rights section points to it. |
| E4 | Fixed | Stray "Last updated" removed from 404 (same file as A5). |

Verification after A: 404, complaints, privacy, terms → **0 FAIL** each (were 0 / 4 / 7 / 7).

## Category B — functionality

| Code | Status | Note |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Fixed | `KEEP` corrected to the page's real ids; the salary slider now sits in the primary group (verified: not inside a closed `<details>` at any width). Pension page's array cleaned of dead ids too. |
| B2 | Fixed | Calendly embed has `onerror` + 8s timeout that hides the embed and reveals the fallback panel and link; dead placeholder branch removed. Tested: failing host → fallback; working script → embed stays. |
| B3 | Fixed | Four-column footer and its CSS ported to booking; booking now links to the director calculator. Screenshot-confirmed at 1440. |
| B4 | Fixed | New "Your annual earnings" slider; relief = min(contribution, age-band % × min(earnings, €115,000)) × tax rate. Independently checked: 35yo/€1,000/€50k → €333 relief on a €10,000 limit; 62yo/€5,000/€200k → €1,533 on €46,000; 28yo/€300/€30k → €120 (no cap). |
| B5 | Fixed | Over-cap note now fires when the contribution exceeds the user's own band and names the limit. Superseded by B4. |
| B6 | Fixed | Hero tile relabelled "Corporation tax relief on contributions" (figure unchanged); "saves €X vs salary" sentence removed; comparison note states both routes are deductible. Intro sentence aligned. |
| B7 | Fixed | Each page's lead payload and mailto body reference only its own result ids; dangling "Estimated monthly income:" line gone. |
| E5 | Fixed (in B) | Stale `CALENDLY_URL` sentinel, dead branch, comments and "once the Calendly link is connected" copy removed alongside B2. |
| F1b | Hardened, **Needs-Damian-Input** | No endpoint invented. With `LEAD_ENDPOINT` empty, the mailto path now also shows an honest on-page panel ("Your email app should have opened… if it didn't, book a free call") instead of "on its way". |
| F1a | **Needs-Damian-Input** | Untouched; guard self-disables. |

Verification after B: booking, director-calculator, pension-calculator → **0 FAIL**; calculator maths check still exact (101,685 = 101,685); Calendly ready-branch still verified. starter/tracker/director carry 1 FAIL each — C1, pre-existing, Category C.
